/**
 * This is a demo program showing the use of the RobotDrive class.
 * The SampleRobot class is the base of a robot application that will
 * automatically call your Autonomous and OperatorControl methods at the right
 * time as controlled by the switches on the driver station or the field
 * controls.
 *
 * WARNING: While it may look like a good choice to use for your code if you're
 * inexperienced, don't. Unless you know what you are doing, complex code will
 * be much more difficult under this system. Use IterativeRobot or Command-Based
 * instead if you're new.
